### Project description
We need to write a program that guesses the number in minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions**
- The PC guesses an integer number from 0 to 100. We need to predict it. By 'predict' we mean to write a program that guesses a number.
- The algorithm takes into info about whether a random number is greater or less than one we need.

**Quality metric**
- The results are evaluated by the average number of attepts with 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
- We learn to write good Python code.
